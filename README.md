# introduction

The code presented in this project has the following objectives:

  * drive the equatorial table in order to compensate the Earth rotation and follow a target in the sky
  * drive the telescope ALT-AZ axis using either an Infra-Red remote or a Python-based interface
  * display sensor values (temperature and humidity)
  * assist the observer in reaching the target by offering a goto solution

The telescope is home-made starting from a blank disk of glass, all the way to fitting a camera for astrophotography. The project is being documented on instructables.com (link to be published later).
