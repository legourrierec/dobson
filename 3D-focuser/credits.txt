This archive was downloaded from the web in 2019.

I intended to give here credits to the author, but when I documented the project on github, I could not find the webpage anymore. If you are the author of the 3D files, please let me know.

In this project, the design were modified (credits to my brother-in-law Jérôme) to adapt to the secondary box.
